The && (logical AND) operator in React is commonly used for conditional rendering.
It allows you to render a component or element only if a certain condition is met.

Basic syntax in Javascript:
The && operator works as follows:

if the left hand-side condition is true, the right hand side expression is returned
if the left hand-side condition is false, nothing (or false) is returned.

console.log(true && "Hello")
console.log(false && "Hello")


&& is useful for conditionally rendering  UI elements only is a condition is true.
Be careful with falsy values (0, null, undefined, false).
if you need an else case, use the ternery operator (? :) instead.


There are two cases:

1. If there is a condition you want to check and send responses according to that
condition then use ternery operator.

2. If there is a condition or value which you want to show only if
it is there and don't show if it is not there then us && operator.
